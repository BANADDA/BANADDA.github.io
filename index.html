            <p class="text" style="font-family: Arial">
              MyHostel is a smartphone application designed to locate places of residency around the University. The app outsources detailed information
              about the different services offered at these places, as well as showing the exact location of these places on the app's built in map.
              Users such as students, sponsors and gurdians can use the information provided by the app to analyze which of these areas best suits them,
              as well as making bookings through the app.

            <p class="text" style="font-family: Arial">
              According to a survey carried out by our Team members in Makerere University,
it was discovered that a large percentage of students face 
a big challenge of locating areas of residency while at campus and some
of these students become victims of fraud while in desperate attemps to acquire bed spaces at campus. Others spend a lot of time devoted
devoted in searching for perfect places where they would spend
their university life from, ending up missing lectures. We know that attending daily classes at the 
campus is very important and leads to better performance as well as attaining the 
right information and skills from lecturers and professors. So this Mobile App is is designed to solve such problems,
 by linking the students directly to the hostel, halls and rentals places available around campus.
